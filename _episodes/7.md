## Show Notes

[Elpy][elpy] is a package that's meant to ease Python development by bringing
IDE-like capabilities into Emacs. These include code-completion, refactoring,
virtualenv handling, Django support, and more. Before Elpy, if one wanted to
create a similar development environment they would need to scavenge blogs, copy
and paste snippets of code and hope that it would all play nicely together.
Fortunately, this was unsatisfactory and gave Jorgen the idea of bundling it all
together into one package which is now called Elpy.

Jorgen is also the author of some other popular packages like [Circe][circe],
an IRC client in Emacs, and [Buttercup][buttercup], a behavior-driven
development framework for testing Emacs Lisp code.

Package shoutout by Jorgen:

- [Dumb Jump][dumb-jump]: an Emacs "jump to definition" package, which doesn't
  try to be smart about jumping to definitions. "Dumb Jump
  uses [The Silver Searcher][ag] `ag`, [ripgrep][rg] `rg`, or `grep` to find
  potential definitions of a function or variable under point."
