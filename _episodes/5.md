**Update:** it came to our attention that unfortunately
Jason [passed](https://tinyletter.com/exercism/letters/in-memoriam-jason-lewis)
[away](https://www.meetup.com/Baltimore-Clojure/messages/boards/thread/50503577)
tragically on December 26, 2016. He was a great force in the Clojure community,
and the organizer of the
[Baltimore Clojure meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Baltimore-Clojure/events/236331471/).
Jason will be dearly missed.
